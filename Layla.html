             <h1>About Me</h1>
             <p>My life has multi destinations,one of them was in Jordan when I have studied my bachelorette degree in Pharmacy and I have graduated from six years ago. The destination next to it was in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where I was working for four years in a hospital in the in-patient section as a pharmacist. However, my dreams have no limitations to stop at that point for the rest of my life
             </p>
             <p>Therefore, I discovered my passion in the digital world especially in the graphics and the infographics as a unique way to visually presenting our important health data to the society to spread the awareness in a special topic.

              <h1>As Graphic Designer</h1>
              <p>I have took a graphic diploma degree out of nine months of studying Adobe software and graphics
                 training productions. I have designed for my Pharmacy I was working with, posters, brochures, meeting presentations,
                  conference flyers, and working right now on developing an IV booklet.
                  Overlapping two majors was one of the greatest experiences I have ever went
                   through as it taught me how the productions would be with higher quality and the skills
                    gained were with advanced level.</p>
