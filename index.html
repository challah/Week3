         <h3>Interest</h3>
         
            <P>I am extremely interested in the development of procedures to counteract prescription drug addiction and to keep
             medications safe from patients that would abuse them. Coding is my particular interest, and I am skilled in working with several
              different programs and databases. I enjoy hiking, kayaking and biking, and anything that is done outdoors. 
              I love sports, basketball, tennis, golf, billiards, however I am in love with Football.   

            </P>
